# Process-mining-
A university project about process mining using the pm4py library <br>
Questions 2-5 are about the original event log.<br>
The code is used to:
1) Read the BPI 2017 challenge dataset (which is an event log) and create a filtered dataset of our choice (Filtered is between dated 1-20 JAN
2) Print the trace and event atrributes
3) Print the number of traces
4) Print the number of events 
5) Print the different names of the events 
6) Use the alpha, heuristics and inductive miner algorithms in order to define the model of processes for both event logs (Original and filtered)
7) Evaluate the models of both event logs and report on their metrics.
8) Conduct conformance checking using the replay fitness method for both event logs
